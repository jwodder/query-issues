This is an experiment in determining the fastest way to use GitHub's GraphQL
API to fetch all open issues in all (public, non-archived, non-fork)
repositories belonging to a collection of owners/organizations.  Each binary
package in this workspace implements a different strategy, detailed below.

Usage
=====

`orgs-then-issues`
------------------

    cargo run [--release] -p orgs-then-issues

Performs a paginated batch query to fetch all (public etc.) repositories
belonging to a hardcoded set of owners, including getting the number of open
issues in each repository.  Then, all repositories that have one or more open
issues are queried in batches to get paginated lists of their open issues.

Outputs the number of repositories fetched (including how many had open
issues), the number of open issues fetched, the elapsed time, and (if possible)
the number of API rate limit points used.


`orgs-with-issues`
------------------

    cargo run [--release] -p orgs-with-issues

Performs a paginated batch query to fetch all (public etc.) repositories
belonging to a hardcoded set of owners; for each repository, the first page of
open issues is also queried at the same time.  Then, all repositories that
still have more open issues are queried repeatedly in batches to get their
remaining pages of open issues.

The key difference from `orgs-then-issues` is that this command fetches a page
of issues for each repository as part of the same requests that fetch the
repositories themselves.

Outputs the number of repositories fetched, the number of open issues fetched,
the elapsed time, and (if possible) the number of API rate limit points used.


`update-issues`
---------------

    cargo run [--release] -p update-issues -- <infile> [<outfile>]

`update-issues` creates or updates a JSON database of open issues, only making
requests for issues that have been updated since the database was last updated.

The program reads a JSON database of repositories and their open issues from
`<infile>`; if the given file does not exist, it is treated as an empty
database.  It then performs a paginated batch query to fetch all (public etc.)
repositories belonging to a hardcoded set of owners, including getting the
number of open issues in each repository.  Then, all repositories that have one
or more open issues are queried in batches to get paginated lists of their
issues ordered by update time.  For repositories that had open issues when the
database was last updated, this query fetches details on all issues, open &
closed, that have been updated since the last run; for other repositories, only
open issues are queried, but the query starts from the beginning of time.  The
issues thus fetched are then added or (for closed issues) removed from the
database as appropriate.  Finally, the updated database is written out to
`<outfile>` if specified, otherwise back to `<infile>`.

`<infile>` and `<outfile>` may be set to `-` to read from stdin/write to
stdout.

`update-issues` outputs to stderr the number of repositories fetched (including
how many had open issues), the number of open issues fetched, the numbers of
repositories & issues in the database that were added/modified/removed, the
elapsed time, and (if possible) the number of API rate limit points used.

> [!NOTE]
> This strategy is unable to update a database to remove issues that have since
> been deleted, transferred to another repository, or converted to discussions.


Authentication
--------------

All commands require a GitHub access token with appropriate permissions in
order to run.  Specify the token via the `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`
environment variable or by storing a token with the
[`gh`](https://github.com/cli/cli) command.
